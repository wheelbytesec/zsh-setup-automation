# 🚀 **Zsh Setup Automation Script** 🖥️

## 🔥 Overview

A few years ago, around the time I was really diving into Linux system administration, I came across [this article](https://ivanaugustobd.medium.com/your-terminal-can-be-much-much-more-productive-5256424658e8) about **Zsh, Oh My Zsh, and Powerlevel10k**. It introduced me to ways to make the terminal more efficient and user-friendly.

After setting up multiple systems with this configuration manually, I wanted a way to streamline the process. **So I built this script to automate everything**. Now, setting up a fresh terminal is as easy as running a single command. 💀⚡

## 🛠️ Features
- ⚡ **Instantly makes Zsh the default shell**
- 🎨 **Auto-installs Oh My Zsh + Powerlevel10k** (for a polished and modern terminal look)
- 🧠 **Installs essential plugins:**
  - 🔵 `zsh-syntax-highlighting`
  - 🟢 `zsh-autosuggestions`
  - 🔍 `history-substring-search`
  - 🏎️ `you-should-use`
- 🎮 **Applies FiraCode Nerd Font** for improved readability
- 🛡️ **Backs up your existing configs** to prevent data loss
- 🚀 **Auto-applies changes and launches straight into Zsh**

## 🏗️ Installation

### 🔻 Step 1: Clone the Repo
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/zsh-setup-automation.git
 cd zsh-setup-automation
```

### ⚙️ Step 2: Run the Script
```sh
 chmod +x install.sh
 ./install.sh
```

### 💾 Step 3: Restart Your Terminal
After the script completes, restart your terminal and enjoy a more efficient shell experience. 😎💻
